With the near unlimited amount of programming related tech tools being released seemingly every day it can be hard to filter out
which ones are worth the time investment and which ones you should let go. My life as a programmer seems to be a constant state of FOMO
analysis paralysis so I try to break down which tech to learn into three categories before diving in.

1. Tools that help you get a job
2. Tools that help you build the thing you want to build
3. Tools that change the way you think about programming

## Tools that help you get a job

The first is mostly geared towards people looking to break into the field, or people looking to make a change in their career. If you are just
starting out one of the fastest ways to improve is to be immersed in programming 40 hours a week. There are plenty of viable ways to learn
other than working, e.g. through school, a coding boot camp, or contributing to open source, but most people still have bills to pay and
if you can pay those bills by coding and being surrounded by other people who code you'll get the best "bang for your time-buck".

Since I currently have a job I'm going to glaze over this section, but if I was just starting out a good bet would be to learn one of the big 3
popular languages (Java, JavaScript, Python) and then a popular web framework for one of those languages. I suppose today that might be 
Spring Boot for Java, React for JavaScript, or Django for Python. Check your local job market though! There are plenty of options for these and
other languages but for the sake of not overthinking it you can't go wrong with one of the above.

## Tools that help you build the thing you want to build

This is where you would land if you already have a job, or don't care about getting a job, and just want to build The Thing in the most effective way
possible. Or maybe you already know how to build The Thing and are looking for different options that help you build it better.

In this case it depends on what your Thing is, but regardless of topic there are almost sure to be focused options catering to exactly what you need.

Want to build a blog? I created mine with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 
seem to be other popular options.

Building a web app that is heavy on the front end? [React](https://reactjs.org/) is eating the world right now, but [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) gets
a lot of praise too. Or maybe try something a bit lighter like [MithrilJs](https://mithril.js.org/).

Who doesn't want to make video games? There are a ton of resources for the C# programming language out there, and it is an officially supported language
for arguably the most popular indie engine available [Unity](https://unity.com/). It's also the default in popular smaller engines 
like [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and the venerable [Monogame](https://www.monogame.net/).

The idea with this category is not to spend too much time worrying about the perfect choice if there are clear quality options available. This should
be heavily influenced by what you already know as well. Pretty comfortable with Ruby and looking to build a SaaS type app? It might make more sense to
go with Rails instead of investing the time to learn Python/Django.

## Tools that change the way you think about programming

This category is not focused on new employment or attempting to build something specific, but is aimed at deepening or broadening your understanding
of the craft of programming. I've found that the more diverse ideas you have on how programs can be constructed, the more easily this 
knowledge can be applied to problems in creative ways. Often times learning to write code in a new approach leads you to new best practices that
can then be applied into your day to day, even if you never end up using the tools that taught you these new techniques directly.

When looking for a new tool in this category I find I tend to gravitate towards learning new programming languages more so than trying out 
specific libraries or developing on new platforms. I suppose this is related to my interest in UI/UX, as programming languages are the
"User Experience" for the programmer. The options available to you in your language of choice will impact the way you approach problems and as
you learn more you will be able to distinguish the relative strengths and weaknesses of your language and use them to your advantage.
