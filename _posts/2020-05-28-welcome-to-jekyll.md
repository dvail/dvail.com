Being stuck in a nation wide semi-quarantine is also a great excuse to turn a hastily thown together resume-site into an actual online home for my creations and thoughts. The hope is that having this blog will give me a place to document side projects and experiments, maybe some artwork, and other cool stuff, instead of letting it slowly fade from memory. 

In making this blog I wanted to keep things simple and get back to the basics of when I learned web design, before JavaScript fatigue, and make a website that was crafted rather than engineered. I like colors, so it will be colorful until it impacts readability, and it should be as fast as possible.

If the placeholder title wasn't a giveaway, this blog is made with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
